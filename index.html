          <h3>What is CDL all about?</h3>
          <p>The free Open Source <strong>Community and Development
          Lab</strong> is a course organized by <a
          href="http://www.rosedu.org/" target="_blank">ROSEdu</a> at <a href="http://www.pub.ro/" target="_blank">University Politehnica of Bucharest</a>.</p>
          <!-- We use JavaScript to load images after all the text has been loaded/displayed, hence the use of src="" below -->
          <p><img id="english_logo" src="" style="float: left;">Currently, at
          its 5th edition, the course aims to help enthusiast undergraduate
          students at University Politehnica of Bucharest to make their first contributions within an open source project and to get a feeling of what real world software development actually means.
          <br>
          The topics covered by this course range from programming language specifics (such as C++/Python/Java/PHP), highlighting object oriented programming concepts and design patterns, to proper project management tools and community integration.</p>
          <p style="clear: both;">
          <br>
          <br>
          The main components of our course are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Theoretical presentations</em> combined with <em>practical laboratories</em> to help students gain technical expertise using various programming languages and open source tools</li>
            <li><em>Development sessions</em> under the guidance of experienced mentors to help students work on specific features of an open source project</li>
            <li><em>Presentations</em> held by invited guests, industry leaders of the Romanian IT community with various topics (careers in software engineering, startups, technology).</li>
          </ul>
	  <h3>CDL v5.0</h3>
	  <p>Another CDL edition is over!</p>
	  <p>We had the lucky 13 number of participants. All the students worked on their projects, and at first some didn’t know what to expect of the project. They received constant support from their mentors, had hackathons, technical presentations (git, vim, python, gsoc opportunities and more), and also soft skills presentations (about leadership, innovation, open source etc.). According to the students’ feedback,  most of their expectations were greatly exceeded.</p>
	  <p>The projects we had were Pidgin, openSIPS, DEXonline (as always), digiKam (a former CDL student now mentoring for it) and awouso (android + WoUSO, another traditional project of ROSEdu). The Dexonline team implemented a very fun Hangman game that’s playable on Dexonline’s homepage. This enjoyed so much popularity that it got featured in a newspaper article. It includes difficulty levels, try it yourself at http://www.dexonline.ro.</p>
	  <p>Thanks to Ixia’s constant support, we’ve managed to have fun after CDL yet again. This time we went on a trip to Bran, Brasov. One can tell we all had a great time by just looking at 10 facebook pictures. Eau de Web brought joy to all of us with a lot of technical books personally recommended by Eau de Web’s employees. And last but not least, Google has offered swag for everybody, including some t-shirts with G+ (very cool).</p>
          <h3>CDL v4.0</h3>
          <p>The 4th edition of the Open Source Development Course is over!<br>After 9 weeks of hard work, commitment and enthusiasm on behalf of both the participants and the mentors, it is safe to say that this was a truly successful edition of the course!</p>
          <p>The outcome was, undoubtedly, remarkable! At the end of the course each team put forward new functionalities that were implemented as patches to the main projects, and that made it back into the mainstream.</p>
          <p>And because we are not the only ones to believe in the importance of this course, this year Eau de Web, Google and IXIA contributed by rewarding the participants with prizes!</p>
          <p>Eau de Web offered books on Open Source and development to each student while IXIA offered a trip to Busteni for the participants and the organizers. Thank you!</p>
          <h3>CDL v3.0</h3>
          <p>The 3rd edition of the Open Source Development Course is over!<br>After 9 weeks of hard work, commitment and enthusiasm on behalf of both the participants and the mentors, it is safe to say that this was a truly successful edition of the course!</p>
          <p>The outcome was, undoubtedly, remarkable! At the end of the course each team put forward new functionalities that were implemented as patches to the main projects, and that made it back into the mainstream.</p>
          <p>And because we are not the only ones to believe in the importance of this course, this year Google and IXIA contributed by rewarding the participants with prizes!</p>
          <p>We especially received support from the IXIA company: a trip to Busteni for the participants and the organizers! In addition to that, we owe the facilities in the laboratory where the CDL takes place exclusively to the effort and implication IXIA has demonstrated within the faculty and within ROSEdu! Thank you!</p>
          <h3>Projects</h3>
          <p>Throughout this course, each student is assigned to work on an open source project, under the guidance of a mentor actively involved in the development and in the community of the project. We aim to bring new contributors to existing open source/free software projects.</p>
          <p>We consider this an immense opportunity for our participants, as they can easily overcome difficulties encountered when setting up the working environment (compiling the code, getting to know how it is organized and so on). Moreover, the mentors assist the development sessions within the course, are able to directly answer technical questions and plan the feature evolution, step by step.</p>
          <p>Last, but not least, we would like to say a big THANK YOU to all the mentors who have dedicated numerous hours of their precious time for the benefit of the participants and the success of this course.</p>
          <h3>Testimonials</h3>
          <p>Results are best measured in time, and we are delighted to hear success stories from our former participants in the software engineering field, where knowledge gained through this course has proven to be vital.</p>

            <blockquote><em>"I participated in my first year as a student and in my second as a mentor. This proves how you can personally evolve through the CDL course. The experience gained through CDL helped me get involved in important open source projects, such as Google Summer of Code."</em></blockquote>

          <p style="clear: both;">
            <blockquote><em>"CDL represented for me a turning point. Until then, I had no idea about how an open source project works. It turned out that I was wrong in many ways: how I should contribute code, how I should work within a team, how I would present the project I’m working on..."</em></blockquote>

          <p style="clear: both;">
            <blockquote><em>"CDL has opened the doors for me to the open-source world. During this course, I learned a lot about different tools and practices that are mostly used in open-source projects, which made me a better programmer. It has also helped me a lot during my Google Summer of Code project in 2010. I am always up-to-date with the evolution of this course and I can say that the team is improving it every year. Congrats to everyone for helping new students learn the ways of open source development and Computer Science in general."</em></blockquote>

          <h3 style="clear: both;">Get involved!</h3>
          <p>We have currently limited our students contributions to communities and projects where we are able to find mentors from our university, to physically be present during the weekend hackatons within the course. This helps a lot ensuring quality for our freshman students, the target audience for CDL, since they can be easily guided on writing code efficiently for the features they are willing to work on.
          <br>
          However, our upcoming project is ROSEdu Summer of Code, inspired from Google's Summer of Code and sponsored (with a smaller remuneration) by our University. It has a slightly different target and stands as mandatory curricular practice for some of our university students, interested in working within an open source project. Particularly, this is a very good opportunity to attract new contributors to your project! Write us, at cdl@rosedu.org, if you are interested.</p>

          <h3>Problema: Inverted Index</h3>
          <p>Un <strong>query</strong> este o propoziție logică de forma:</p>
	  <pre style="font-family: monospace; white-space: pre;">
token(1) operator(1) token(2) operator(2) ... operator(k-1) token(k)</pre>
	  <p>Unde token(i) este un cuvânt format din caractere alfanumerice oricare ar fi i, iar operator(i) aparține mulțimii <strong>{'|','&'}</strong> oricare ar fi i. Operatorul '&' este echivalent cu "și" logic, iar operatorul '|' este echivalent cu "sau" logic. Pentru simplitate, se consideră că cei doi operatori ('|' și '&') au aceeași prioritate.</p> 
	 
	 <h3>Cerință</h3>
	 <p>Având date <strong>n</strong> fișiere și <strong>m</strong> query-uri să se stabilească pentru fiecare query fișierele care îl respectă(la evaluarea acestui query se obține valoarea <strong>true</strong>). Pentru a determina valoarea de adevăr a unui query veți folosi <strong>InvertedIndex</strong>.<p>
	
	 <h3>Date de Intrare</h3>
	 <ul>
	   <li>Un fișier numit <strong>input.in</strong>. Acesta va conține pe prima linie numărul de fișiere n. Pe următoarele n linii se vor afla numele fișierelor pe care vor fi testate query-urile. Pe linia n+2 se va afla numărul de query-uri m. Pe următoarele m linii se vor afla cele m query-uri.</li>
	   <li>n fișiere text. Numele fișierelor trebuie să corespundă cu cele din fișierul input.in.</li>
	 </ul>
	 
	 <h3>Date de Ieșire</h3>
	 <ul>
	   <li>Fișierul de ieșire se va numi <strong>output.out</strong>. Acesta va conține m linii de forma:
           <pre style="font-family: monospace; white-space: pre;">
query: index_fisier1 ... index_fisier_k</pre>
	  unde index_fisier_1, ..., index_fisier_k sunt numerele de ordine ale fișierelor pentru care valoarea query-ului este true.
	   </li>
	 </ul>

     <h3>Schelet de Cod</h3>
     <ul>
     <li><strong>Scheletele de cod pentru C, C++ și Java le găsiți pe <a href="https://github.com/rosedu/cdl/tree/master/2013/schelet_inscriere" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</strong></li>  
     </ul>
	
	 <h3>Observații</h3>
	 <ul>
	   <li>n, m - numere naturale nenule mai mici decât 500</li>
	   <li>lungimea unui query este variabilă</li>
	   <li>între token-uri și operatori este <strong>un singur</strong> spațiu</li>
       <li>Lungimea unei linii dintr-un fișier este de maxim 2000 de
       caractere</li>
	   <li><strong>Trebuie respectat scheletul de cod pentru limbajul ales</strong></li>
       <li><strong>Problema se testează pe Linux, dar terminatorii pentru fișierele de intrare sunt CLRF !</strong></li>
       <li><strong>Aveți grijă la separatorii din fișierele de text!</strong> Nu orice nu este alfanumeric este considerat separator. Spre exemplu, cratima nu este considerată separator, dar semnele de punctuație și spațiul da.</li>
	 </ul>
	
	 <h3>Exemplu</h3>
	 <p>Pentru fișierul de intrare:</p>
	 <pre style="font-family: monospace; white-space: pre;">
2
data1.in
data2.in
3
Ana
Ana | mere
Ana & mere</pre>
	 <p>și fișierele:</p>
	 <ul>
	   <li>data1.in
           <pre style="font-family: monospace; white-space: pre;">
Ana are mere si pere</pre>
	   </li>
	   <li>data2.in
           <pre style="font-family: monospace; white-space: pre;">
In copac sunt mere</pre>
	   </li>
	 </ul>
	 <p>se va obține ieșirea:</p>
	 <pre style="font-family: monospace; white-space: pre;">
Ana: 0
Ana | mere: 0 1
Ana & mere: 0</pre>

	 <h3>Explicații</h3>
	 <ul>
	   <li>Primul query are valoarea true dacă în fișier se găsește cuvântul "Ana".</li>
	   <li>Al doilea query are valoarea true dacă în fișier există fie cuvântul "Ana", fie cuvântul "mere", fie ambele cuvinte</li>

      <h3>Proiect CDL: VMChecker + mozaic.js</h3>
		  <p>In this project we want to build a responsive web interface using <a href="https://github.com/ubervu/mozaic" target="_blank">mozaic.js</a> that will streamline the usage of vmchecker.
		  <br>
		  <a href="https://gihub.com/vmchecker/vmchecker" target="_blank">vmchecker</a> is an open source tool for automatic homework evaluation, developed by the <a href="http://rosedu.org" target="_blank">ROSEdu community</a>.
		  <br>
          <a href="https://github.com/ubervu/mozaic" target="_blank">mozaic.js</a> is an open source framework developed by <a href="http://twitter.com/ubervu" target="_blank">@ubervu</a> for building complex single page applications for the browser (think GMail and Twitter).
		  </p>
		  <h3>Details</h3>
		  <p>You have all used vmchecker before and you know that sometimes it's a pain.
		  <br>
		  In this project we want to fix two urgent issues about it:
		  <ul>
		    <li>the inefficient way in which a student can check his/her homework grades and TA's observations, constantly having to refresh the application to see if their homework has been graded.</li>
			<li>the TA's have difficulties checking the homework's source code, running the automated test suite and making observations on the code itself. For example to see the source code of your homework they have to ssh into the server storing the homeworks and review it from there.</li>
		  </ul>
		  </p>
		  <h3>Solution</h3>
		  <p>Inspired by github's interface, the solution we're proposing is a single page application where:
          <ul>
		   <li>Students can easily see the problems text, their grades, the TA's observations, and the tests results all in one page.</li>
		   <li>The app will automatically email all this information to the student when a TA has finished checking his homework, so no more frantic refreshes needed.</li>
		   <li>For TA's we will implement an interface where they can see the results of the test suite, the source code of the homework and make comments on individual source lines.</li>
		   <li>Below is a screenshot from github that approximates what we have in mind for the TA's interface:</li>
		  </ul>
 		  <img id="vmchecker_1" src="">
		  </p>
		  <h3>Tasks</h3>
		  <ol>
        <li>Use <a href="https://github.com/ubervu/mozaic" target="_blank">mozaic.js</a> to rebuild the ui for the homework results page.</li>
        <li>Use <a href="https://github.com/ubervu/mozaic" target="_blank">mozaic.js</a> to build the TA's ui and help them grade the homeworks easily.</li>
        <li>Implement a python email alerts system to notify the student when his/her homework is graded.</li>
        <li>If we will have enough time, we will try to implement more features for the applicatons.</li>
		  </ol>
		  <h3>Tech</h3>
		  <p>The project implemetation will be done using <a href="https://github.com/ubervu/mozaic" target="_blank">mozaic.js</a> which was designed to help you build single page apps that will run on any platform, browser or form-factor.
		  <br>
		  Mozaic is built on top of great open source projects.
		  <br>
		  Intimate knowledge of these projects is not required. What is required is the will and interest to learn them.
		  <ul>
		   <li><a href="http://coffeescript" target="_blank">coffeescript</a> - is a programming language that  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler" target="_blank">transcompiles</a> to javascript code. Its syntax is similar to ruby and python. The coffeescript code is concise and expressive. The compiled javascript code is easy to read and is teeming with best practices. It's actually a good way to learn javascript.</li>
		  <li><a href="http://backbonejs.org" target="_blank">backbone.js</a> - minimalist application framework. It's the backbone of mozaic providing Models and Collections that sync data with server, Views and basic Router functionality.</li>
		  <li><a href="http://underscorejs.org" target="_blank">underscore.js</a> - is a small toolset that offers useful functionality missing from standard js. It's also a dependency for backbone.</li>
		  <li> <a href="http://jqfundamentals.com " target="_blank">jquery.js</a> - levels up all browser inconsistencies (e.g. DOM events, DOM traversal, AJAX) and provides an excellent base for javascript applications.</li>
		  <li><a href="http://requirejs.org" target="_blank">require.js</a> - indispensable tool for large apps, require.js helps keep mozaic code modular. It also manages module dependencies.</li>
		  </ul>
		  </p>
		  <h3>What will you learn on this project</h3>
		  <p>First and foremost, you will learn the startup's approach to doing projects: getting things done!
		  <br>
		  You will learn the tools, techniques, tricks and hazards of developing state of the art web applications.
		  <br>
		  You will learn to develop code socially using github.
		  <br>
		  You will learn to create high quality code by testing it in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development" target="_blank">behavior driven way</a>.

          <h3>Descriere</h3>
          <p>WHC Core este destinat executării pogramelor în sisteme distribuite precum sunt clusterele sau o rețea de calculatoare. Pentru a folosi la maxim toate resursele disponibile, programele sunt bazate pe OpenCL, folosind atât resursele disponibile pe partea de CPU cât și pe partea de GPU(Placa grafică).
          <br>
          WHC IDE este destinat dezvoltării programelor care rulează pe clustere. Compilează și rulează proiectele local, însă e în stare să folosească atât procesorul, cât și placa grafică. Include un editor text, diagramă pentru reprezentarea  workflow-ului și creare/management proiect. Aici este un model grafic despre organizarea unor module în WHC IDE și interdependențele:

	  <h3>Descriere Task-uri</h3>
	  <p> La moment WHC IDE este în proces de trecere la TDD(test driven development), deci se acceptă in repo doar teste, sau features+ teste. Pentru a vă familiariza cu codul, la început vor fi propuse câteva task-uri ușoare(10 min pentru mine, dar eu cunosc tot codul):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>[BUG] Execuția eșuează dacă folderul Execute nu este prezent in directoriul task-ului. De adaugat o verificare suplimentară a directoriului unde se scrie.</li>
            <li>[BUG] Programul nu poate copia fișierele de output daca Data Folder-ul nu există. De creeat directoriul inainte de copiere.</li>

          </ul>
          <h3>Task-uri Intermediare</h3>
	  <p>Task-urile intermediare nu sunt dificile însă, trebuie scris mai mult decât câteva rânduri de cod:</p> 
          <ul>
            <li>[FEATURE] La crearea proiectului, este necesar să fie creeată o clasa main.c sau .cpp în care să se exemplifice modul de utilizare a argumentelor folosite de IDE la rulare</li>

            <li>[REFACTORIZARE] Unificarea tuturor setărilor într-o singură clasă(structură)</li>
          </ul>
	  <h3> Task-uri Heroes Needed </h3>
	  <ul>
	    <li>[BUG] Syntax Highlighting-ul din setări corupe fișierele de configurare.</li>
	  </ul>
          <h3>Tehnologii folosite</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>C++/Qt</li>
            <li>Qt Unit Test Suite</li>
	        <li>cmake</li>
	        <li>OpenCL</li>
          </ul>

	  <h3>Cunoștințe necesare</h3>
	  <ul>
 	    <li>C/C++,OOP (cel puțin, C + partea de structuri in C sa o cunoașteți foarte bine)</li>
	    <li>Git - foarte important. înainte de a începe lucrul la proiect, creați-vă un cont pe github.com și exersați comenzi de git (creare, pull, push, creare branch-uri, rezolvare conflicte).</li>
	    <li>Qt API - opțional, dar binevenit</li>
	  </ul> 	

          <h3>Parcurgeți</h3>
          <p>Recomandăm să citiți/parcurgeți următoarele:</p>
          <ul>

            </li>
          </ul>

	  <h3>Observații</h3>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Pentru lucrul la acest proiect, aveți nevoie de un sistem, preferabil Linux, cu Qt SDK instalat + QtCreator</li>
	    <li>În repo-ul de git este disponibil un .pro pentru QtCreator și un CMakeLists.txt pentru cmake.</li>
	    <li>Aveți nevoie de un calculator cu un procesor dual-core(nu conteaza de ce tip)</li>
	    <li>Pentru a fi eficienți, vă sfătuiesc să parcurgeți tutorialul Qt + să experimentați cu git înainte de începerea cursului. Cunoștințele de git vă vor ajuta la orice proiect open-source, nu doar la WHC IDE sau cele prezentate la acest curs.</li>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Development</strong>:</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Descriere</h3>
          <p>Dezvoltarea de add-ons pentru cel mai popular browser open source - 
Mozilla Firefox. Utilizând noul SDK se pot crea extensii atât pentru platformele
 desktop, cât și pentru cele mobile (Android). Asemenea browser-ului majoritatea
 extensiilor sunt proiecte open source, cei interesați putând foarte ușor să contribuie
 atât la extensiile existente cât și să dezvolte unele noi.
          <br>
          Popularitatea browserului Firefox se datorează în principiu acestor extensii. 
 Oricine se poate alătura comunității de sute de dezvoltatori.
          <br>
          </p>
	  
          <h3>Tehnologii</h3>

	  <h3>About</h3>
	  <p>As HTML5 is getting more and more powerful, more and more people start creating presentations as HTML pages instead of PowerPoint or Keynote. A number of frameworks for HTML presentation have also been created (such as Akim El Hatab's Reveal.js framework). However, as cool as these new presentations are, creating them requires manual coding.</p>
	  <p>The goal of this project is to create a web-based slide authoring tool to author Reveal.js slides. The UI would let the users edit the content visually, chose transitions for the slides, apply shaders etc</p>

	  <h3>Why this project?</h3>
	  <ul>
	    <li>You get to learn and use JavaScript and maybe some Node.js</li>
	    <li>It’s a fun and interesting project and practical</li>
	    <li>It doesn’t have to be compatible with IE8</li>
	    <li>The web is fun</li>
	  </ul>

	  <h3>Features to implement</h3>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Save the presentation state if the user leaves the page without downloading the application</li>
	    <li>Using 1. you could make a modification stack so that the user could roll back to previous versions (+keybindings CTRL-Z)</li>
	    <li>Save the presentations online. Easier to share / can be viewed by others</li>
	    <li>Code refactoring ? Interface improvements</li>
	    <li>More options for the presentation, different effects for transitions. (see kreator or http://rvl.io)</li>
	  </ul>

	 <h3>Tehnologii Folosite</h3>
	 <ul>
	   <li>GTK - majoritatea bugurilor sunt legate de interfață</li>
	   <li>Encoding MP3, etc.</li>
   	   <li>Există două repository-uri: unul pentru core app și unul pentru plugins. De fapt, pentru a putea compila de mână tot codul sunt necesare 4 repository-uri cu biblioteci diverse (libguess, libmowgli, libmcs - de la Atheme Project)</li>
	 </ul>

	 <h3>Necesar</h3>
	 <ul>
	   <li>Cunoștințe de C</li>
	   <li>Cunoștințe de linkare, încare biblioteci, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc</li>

          <p><strong>Development</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/dserban/I.GameBot" target="_blank">https://github.com/dserban/I.GameBot</a></p>

          <h3>Descriere</h3>
          <p><strong>I, GameBot</strong> își propune să fie o platformă pentru organizarea de concursuri de programare cu codul-sursă la vedere. Majoritatea platformelor existente le permit participanţilor să ţină ascuns algoritmul cu care concurează. Făcând public accesul la algoritmii tuturor participanţilor, "I, GameBot" va scoate în evidenţă dinamica interacţiunilor sociale spontane dintr-un ecosistem free-libre software - mai precis, simbioza dintre colaborare si competiţie.
          <br>
          <br>
          Proiectul îl veţi implementa de la zero urmând cu stricteţe metodologia TDD (Test-Driven Development) și design pattern-ul "Functional Core, Imperative Shell".</p>

    	<h3>Proiect CDL: CMUSphinx</h3>
		<p><strong>Proiect</strong>: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/</a></p>
		<p><strong>Wiki proiect</strong>: <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/wiki/" target="_blank">http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/wiki/</a></p>
		<h3>Descriere</h3>
	  	<p>CMUSPhinx este unul dintre cele mai bune toolkit-uri de recunoaștere automată a vorbirii, folosită pentru crearea de aplicații bazate pe vorbire. Acest toolkit are un numar mare de programe pentru diferite probleme și aplicații. Acestea sunt:
			<ul> 
				<li>Pocketsphinx - biblioteca minimală de recunoaștere a vorbirii scrisă în C</li>
				<li>Sphinxbase - biblioteca de suport pentru PocketSphinx</li>
				<li>Sphinx4 - recognizer de vorbire ajustabil și modificabil scris în Java</li>
				<li>CMUclmtk - tool pentru modele de limbă</li>
				<li>Sphinxtrain - tool pentru antrenarea de modele acustice</li>
				<li>Sphinx3 - decodor de recunoaștere a vorbirii scris în C</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Avantajele folosirii CMUSphinx pentru construirea de aplicații de recunoaștere a limbii:
			<ul>
				<li>Algoritmii state-of-the-art pentru recunoașterea eficientă a vorbirii. Tool-urile CMUSphinx poti fi folosite și pe platforme cu puține resurse</li>
				<li>Design flexibil (!)</li>
				<li>Concentrare pe dezvoltarea de aplicații practice și nu pe cercetare</li>
				<li>Suport pentru multe limbi cum ar fi engleza US/UK, franceza, chineza, germana, olandeza, rusa și posibilitatea de a construi modele pentru altele (există un laborator în UPB care se ocupă de modelul limbii române)</li>
				<li>Licență BSD</li>
				<li>Dezvoltare activă</li>
				<li>Comunitate activă</li>
				<li>Multe tool-uri pentru scopuri similare recunoașterii vorbirii (keywork spotting, alignment, pronunciation evaluation)</li>		
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h3>Proiect propus</h3>
		<h4>Speaker Diarization - SD (separarea vorbirii în funcție de vorbitori)</h4>
		<p>Acest proiect va fi o îmbunătățire importantă a toolkit-ului. Presupune împărțirea vorbirii în funcție de vorbitori, fără cunoașterea anterioară a numărului total și are aplicații în multe domenii.</p>
		<p>Pași în realizarea proiectului:
		<ol>
		<li>familiarizarea cu teoria implicată în recunoașterea vorbirii</li>
		<li>familiarizarea cu toolkit-ul CMUSphinx (realizarea unei aplicații de recunoaștere de mici dimensiuni)</li>
		<li>cercetare de paper-uri care au ca temă SD</li>
		<li>implementarea unei soluții în cadrul toolkit-ului</li>
		</ol></p>
		<p>Pași ulteriori (opționali, dar încurajați):
		<ul>
		<li>îmbunătățirea proiectului</li>
		<li>contribuții în cadrul comunității CMUSphinx</li>
		<li>aprofundarea temei</li>
