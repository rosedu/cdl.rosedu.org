          <h3>What is CDL all about?</h3>
          <p>The free Open Source <strong>Community and Development
          Lab</strong> is a course organized by <a
          href="http://www.rosedu.org/" target="_blank">ROSEdu</a> at <a href="http://www.pub.ro/" target="_blank">University Politehnica of Bucharest</a>.</p>
          <!-- We use JavaScript to load images after all the text has been loaded/displayed, hence the use of src="" below -->
          <p><img id="english_logo" src="" style="float: left;">Currently, at
          its 7th edition, the course aims to help enthusiast undergraduate
          students at University Politehnica of Bucharest to make their first contributions within an open source project and to get a feeling of what real world software development actually means.
          <br>
          The topics covered by this course range from programming language specifics (such as C++/Python/Java/PHP), highlighting object oriented programming concepts and design patterns, to proper project management tools and community integration.</p>
          <p style="clear: both;">
          <br>
          <br>
          The main components of our course are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Theoretical presentations</em> combined with <em>practical laboratories</em> to help students gain technical expertise using various programming languages and open source tools</li>
            <li><em>Development sessions</em> under the guidance of experienced mentors to help students work on specific features of an open source project</li>
            <li><em>Presentations</em> held by invited guests, industry leaders of the Romanian IT community with various topics (careers in software engineering, startups, technology).</li>
          </ul>

    <h3>CDL v1.0 @ unibuc</h3>
      <p>In the fall of 2013 we had our first CDL at the University of Bucharest. The Google Ambassador's Team from the University of Bucharest,
      and ROSEdu shared the love for open source with 12 students, which contributed to 4 projects.</p>
      <p>The projects were: GNOME Music Player, MonoDevelop, ROSEdu People and MPTracker.</p>
      <p>The weekly workshops were held by students from both universities, and covered areas like: Git and GitHub, Linux, Python, Django, Flask.</p>
      <p>Thanks to Google's support, we’ve shared swag and drinks with our colleagues.</p>

    <h3>CDL v6.0</h3>
      <p>The sixth edition of CDL is over!</p>
      <p>More and more people are willing to help us so we had twice as many projects as in prevous editions. Because more projects means more students in v6 we worked with 20 students splitted in two teams based on their project theme (web and non web). Students worked on their projects assisted by one or two mentors attended tehnical and non thenical presentations(git, functional programming, how to build your own start up).</p>
      <p>The projects we had were WHC:IDE, Firefox Add-ons, DexOnline, vmchecker, WoUSO on Android, kreator.js, Audacious, Moodle, I GameBot, CMUSphinx and World of USO. Most of students' contibutions are now in upstream.</p>
      <p>We can tell that CDL reached its goal because most of our students applied and were accepted at Google Summer of Code or ROSEdu Summer of code. Also, the winner of the <a href="http://uc.rosedu.org/en/#acasa" traget="_blank">Upstream Challenge (first year track)</a> was working on vmchecker project.</p>
      <p>Special thanks to UberVU who offered mentorship for vmchecker project and to Ixia for a very fun laser tag night.</p>

    <h3>CDL v5.0</h3>
    <p>Another CDL edition is over!</p>
    <p>We had the lucky 13 number of participants. All the students worked on their projects, and at first some didn’t know what to expect of the project. They received constant support from their mentors, had hackathons, technical presentations (git, vim, python, gsoc opportunities and more), and also soft skills presentations (about leadership, innovation, open source etc.). According to the students’ feedback,  most of their expectations were greatly exceeded.</p>
    <p>The projects we had were Pidgin, openSIPS, DEXonline (as always), digiKam (a former CDL student now mentoring for it) and awouso (android + WoUSO, another traditional project of ROSEdu). The Dexonline team implemented a very fun Hangman game that’s playable on Dexonline’s homepage. This enjoyed so much popularity that it got featured in a newspaper article. It includes difficulty levels, try it yourself at http://www.dexonline.ro.</p>
    <p>Thanks to Ixia’s constant support, we’ve managed to have fun after CDL yet again. This time we went on a trip to Bran, Brasov. One can tell we all had a great time by just looking at 10 facebook pictures. Eau de Web brought joy to all of us with a lot of technical books personally recommended by Eau de Web’s employees. And last but not least, Google has offered swag for everybody, including some t-shirts with G+ (very cool).</p>
          <h3>CDL v4.0</h3>
          <p>The 4th edition of the Open Source Development Course is over!<br>After 9 weeks of hard work, commitment and enthusiasm on behalf of both the participants and the mentors, it is safe to say that this was a truly successful edition of the course!</p>
          <p>The outcome was, undoubtedly, remarkable! At the end of the course each team put forward new functionalities that were implemented as patches to the main projects, and that made it back into the mainstream.</p>
          <p>And because we are not the only ones to believe in the importance of this course, this year Eau de Web, Google and IXIA contributed by rewarding the participants with prizes!</p>
          <p>Eau de Web offered books on Open Source and development to each student while IXIA offered a trip to Busteni for the participants and the organizers. Thank you!</p>
          <h3>CDL v3.0</h3>
          <p>The 3rd edition of the Open Source Development Course is over!<br>After 9 weeks of hard work, commitment and enthusiasm on behalf of both the participants and the mentors, it is safe to say that this was a truly successful edition of the course!</p>
          <p>The outcome was, undoubtedly, remarkable! At the end of the course each team put forward new functionalities that were implemented as patches to the main projects, and that made it back into the mainstream.</p>
          <p>And because we are not the only ones to believe in the importance of this course, this year Google and IXIA contributed by rewarding the participants with prizes!</p>
          <p>We especially received support from the IXIA company: a trip to Busteni for the participants and the organizers! In addition to that, we owe the facilities in the laboratory where the CDL takes place exclusively to the effort and implication IXIA has demonstrated within the faculty and within ROSEdu! Thank you!</p>
          <h3>Projects</h3>
          <p>Throughout this course, each student is assigned to work on an open source project, under the guidance of a mentor actively involved in the development and in the community of the project. We aim to bring new contributors to existing open source/free software projects.</p>
          <p>We consider this an immense opportunity for our participants, as they can easily overcome difficulties encountered when setting up the working environment (compiling the code, getting to know how it is organized and so on). Moreover, the mentors assist the development sessions within the course, are able to directly answer technical questions and plan the feature evolution, step by step.</p>
          <p>Last, but not least, we would like to say a big THANK YOU to all the mentors who have dedicated numerous hours of their precious time for the benefit of the participants and the success of this course.</p>
          <h3>Testimonials</h3>
          <p>Results are best measured in time, and we are delighted to hear success stories from our former participants in the software engineering field, where knowledge gained through this course has proven to be vital.</p>

            <blockquote><em>"CDL represented for me a turning point. Until then, I had no idea about how an open source project works. It turned out that I was wrong in many ways: how I should contribute code, how I should work within a team, how I would present the project I’m working on..."</em></blockquote>

          <p style="clear: both;">
            <blockquote><em>"CDL has opened the doors for me to the open-source world. During this course, I learned a lot about different tools and practices that are mostly used in open-source projects, which made me a better programmer. It has also helped me a lot during my Google Summer of Code project in 2010. I am always up-to-date with the evolution of this course and I can say that the team is improving it every year. Congrats to everyone for helping new students learn the ways of open source development and Computer Science in general."</em></blockquote>

          <h3 style="clear: both;">Get involved!</h3>
          <p>We have currently limited our students contributions to communities and projects where we are able to find mentors from our university, to physically be present during the weekend hackatons within the course. This helps a lot ensuring quality for our freshman students, the target audience for CDL, since they can be easily guided on writing code efficiently for the features they are willing to work on.
          <br>
          However, our upcoming project is ROSEdu Summer of Code, inspired from Google's Summer of Code and sponsored (with a smaller remuneration) by our University. It has a slightly different target and stands as mandatory curricular practice for some of our university students, interested in working within an open source project. Particularly, this is a very good opportunity to attract new contributors to your project! Write us, at cdl@rosedu.org, if you are interested.</p>
